 Problem:
 "Create a simple system in which a user is able to come, sign up with basic attributes like name, age, city, the grade of study, the board of study. Then on the backside, we should be able to assign some classes and questions to him. The user will be able to see upcoming classes on his side and some questions. For simplicity, the questions can be simple text. I mainly want to see the API creation part as well."
